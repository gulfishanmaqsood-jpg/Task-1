Found 4 open ports
Port 1 : 135/tcp   open  msrpc

Port 135/tcp is typically used by the Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (MSRPC) service, also known as the RPC Endpoint Mapper.
Security Concerns:
Port 135 is frequently targeted in Windows-based attacks.
It has been associated with historical vulnerabilities like Blaster, Sasser, and Conficker worms.
If not needed, this port should be blocked externally by firewalls.
It's generally safe only within internal networks, never exposed to the internet.

Port 2: 139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn

Service on Port 139/tcp
Port: 139/tcp
Service Name: netbios-ssn
Full Name: NetBIOS Session Service
Used by: Server Message Block (SMB) protocol (on older versions)
Common on: Windows systems (especially pre-Windows 2000)

Security Implications of Port 139
Port 139 is a major security risk when exposed to the internet:

Risk	Description
Unauthorized access	Attackers may try to access shared folders/printers
Historical vulnerabilities	Many worms and exploits (like Conficker) have targeted SMB over port 139
Information leakage	Can reveal computer names, workgroup/domain info, shared folders, etc.

Port 3: 445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds

Service on Port 445/tcp

Port: 445/tcp
Service Name: microsoft-ds
Used by: SMB (Server Message Block) over TCP/IP
Typical OS: Windows systems (but also available on Linux/Samba)

Security Risks of Port 445
Risk	Description
Exploits	EternalBlue, WannaCry, and NotPetya all exploited SMB on port 445
Unintended access	Attackers may access shared folders or admin shares
Information leakage	Can expose system info, user accounts, network shares
Internet exposure	Port 445 should never be exposed to the internet — it's one of the most scanned and attacked ports

Port 4: 12345/tcp open  netbus

Port 12345/tcp being open and labeled as netbus is a major red flag — it's strongly associated with a remote access trojan (RAT) from the late 1990s called NetBus.

Service on Port 12345/tcp
Port: 12345/tcp
Service Name: netbus
Used by: NetBus Remote Administration Tool (RAT)
Type: Malware / Trojan backdoor
Operating System: Primarily targets Windows

What is NetBus?
NetBus is one of the earliest remote control trojans, similar to Back Orifice. It allows an attacker to:
View and control the victim’s desktop
Log keystrokes
Access, delete, or modify files
Control mouse/keyboard
Open/close CD tray (back in the day!)
Execute arbitrary commands or programs

Why Is This a Problem?
If port 12345 is open and responding as netbus, it strongly suggests:
The system might be infected with a NetBus trojan (or something impersonating it)
A backdoor is listening for remote command
The system is at serious risk of compromise
Even though NetBus is old (from around 1998), modern malware may still reuse this port or behave similarly.

Top Security Risks from Open Ports
1. Unauthorized Access
Open ports can expose services like RDP (3389), SSH (22), or SMB (445).
If weak or default credentials are used, attackers can gain remote control.
Example: Exposed RDP with a weak password = remote system takeover.

2. Vulnerability Exploits
Services listening on open ports may have known vulnerabilities.
Attackers scan for these ports and exploit unpatched software.
Example: EternalBlue exploited SMB on port 445, leading to WannaCry ransomware.

3. Malware Communication (C2 Channels)
Open ports can be used by malware for command-and-control (C2) communication.
Some backdoors or RATs (e.g., NetBus on port 12345) listen on non-standard ports.
If malware opens a port, attackers can control your machine remotely.

4. Information Disclosure
Some services leak system or network information.
Open NetBIOS, SNMP, or FTP ports can reveal OS details, shared files, or device names.
Example: NetBIOS on port 139 can expose shared folders and usernames.

5. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
Open ports increase the attack surface for flooding or crashing services.
Attackers can send malformed or excessive requests to overwhelm a service.
Example: Open DNS resolvers (port 53) can be abused in DDoS amplification attacks.

6. Lateral Movement Inside Network

Once attackers get into one system, open ports let them move laterally to others.
Services like SMB, WinRM, or SSH help attackers pivot and expand control.
They exploit one weak link, then spread across your network.

7. Port Knocking or Backdoors

Some ports might not appear suspicious but are used in port knocking or custom backdoors.
Can be used to evade detection until triggered by a specific pattern.
